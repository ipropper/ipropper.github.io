Each rules is told to us by Arkhad, the richest man in Babylon
(Hey that's the book's title!). Now let's go over each of Arkhad's rules, and
learn how to [Walk Like a Babylonian](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Cv6tuzHUuuk)
(close enough).

## 1. Start Thy Purse To Fattening

> "Thy purse will start to fatten at once and its increasing weight will feel good
in thy hand." - Arkhad, the Richest Man in Babylon (19)

Arkhad offers a simple cure to a lean wallet. Save money. Mind :boom:. More precisely,
devote 10% (minimum) of each paycheck towards savings. Parting ways with
1/10th of your salary can be difficult, but to that Akhad says
 "I managed to get along just as well." (19). `-_-`, well I made it this far,
 might as well try it out.

### Modern Translation

- Setup automatic withdraws from your bank account to a savings/investment account.
- Each withdraw should be at least 10% of your paycheck.

Example:

If you make 100$ a month, 10$ should go towards savings. After 10 months you'll have one month's paycheck saved, after 10 years you'll 1 years saved.
Math's cool like that :sunglasses:.

## 2. Control Thy Expenditure

> " Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of living... Certain
accepted expenses may wisely be reduced or eliminated" - Arkhad, The Riches Man in Babylon (20)

Spend less, and you will have more money. Another mental puzzle from Arkhad.
However, the lesson is not entirely obvious. Arkhad doesn't just say "spend less",
he also advises you to record your spending. In recording
you might find ways to save. While each of my 73 and a half beany baby purchases
were completely necessary
(sorry [Valentino](http://lovemybeanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Valentino.jpg), we're both hearth broken now), this lesson could help me cut non essentials.
Maybe I could do without heating this month, it's usually nice out in February :sunny:.

### Modern Translation

- Record purchases, see what you can cut. Try budgeting apps like
[mint](https://www.mint.com/), it automatically tracks your spending.
- Eat out less, cook more.
- Only drink water, it's healthy yay! and flavorless, yay?
- Lower gas/heating/electricity use
- Walk/run/bike instead of other transport
- Don't develop a crippling addiction to plushy toys


## 3. Make Thy Gold Multiply
>A man's wealth is not in the coins he carries... It is the
income he buildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse." - Arkhad, The Richy Rich in Babylon (21)

Saving money is great! But if you don't do anything with it, it'll
lay there and do nothing. Sorta like my stoner friend Tyler.  It would be nice if
it could grow up and get a job. That's what this lesson is all about (Tyler).
Getting your money working for you, so you have "a golden stream that continually floweth into your purse." (is that a weird Analogy?). Akhad states that every coin you make is a potential worker. All you need to do is invest it.

### Modern Translation

Seek out investment opportunities.

Some ideas:
- [ETFs](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money/)
- Bonds/CD
- [IRA](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-opening-an-ira-1607498930)
- 401K
- [Real-Estate](https://www.reit.com/)

I setup a [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/) account
that automatically withdraws and invests for me.
There may be better investments, but this was great for getting
my feet wet. (The golden stream thing is weird now, isn't it...)


## 4. Guard Thy Treasure From Loss

> "Would you go to the breadmaker to inquire about the stars?" - Arkhad,
The Golden Stream Guy (13)

When I first read this rule I thought it meant protect your money
from thieves and robbers. As I read more
I understood "loss" to be something more subtle. Loss
is better categorized as falling prey to a lack of information.

The core idea is, you should make informed investments.
Don't buy something without shopping around. Get quotes,
second opinions etc. The book tackles this idea with a question:

> Should you trust brick makers with jewelry investments?

In the book Algamish trusts the brick maker, and ends up penny-less.
The takeaway, why would a brick maker know about jewels? Shouldn't you go to  a jeweler? The point is, not all advice is good advice (except Arkhad's becuase reasons). Try to learn enough about a market to discern good advice from bad.

### My Translation

- Always shop around.

- Read about what you're investing in.

- Seek professional advice. Questions are often free.

## 5. Make Of Thy Dwelling A Profitable Investment

> "To a man's heart it brings gladness to eat the figs from his own trees." - Arkhad, The $ In Babylon (23)

This rule argues it is often better to buy a home then to rent it. I'm not sure that's always true, but at some point buying can be cheaper than renting. Also grow figs? But it's February in Michigan.....

### Modern Translation

- One should weigh the cost of renting an apartment vs buying a home.

- Your assets can produce value.
You can rent your room with [air bnb](https://www.airbnb.com/), car with
[turo](https://turo.com/), and even parking space with [spot hero](https://spothero.com/rent-my-parking-space/).


## 6. Insure Future income

> "A lean purse to a man no longer able to earn ... is a sore tragedy" - Arkhad, The
You Get The Point

If you live paycheck to paycheck, emergencies can be tough. When you have no money saved, you can't support bad luck. You might be forced to take out a loan, or sell
half a beany baby, just to pay for living expenses. This rule is all about having a small sum of cash reserved to cushion unexpected bad news.

### Modern Translation

- Consider following this [vanguard guide](https://investor.vanguard.com/emergency-fund/),
for an emergency fund.

- Have 3-6 months expenses put in a [high yield savings account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/banking/best-savings-accounts).
This money will only be used in emergency.

- If you're having trouble saving for emergencies, divert some of the 10% income  towards an emergency fund.


## 7. Increase Your Ability To Learn

>"Work is the best Friend I've ever known"- Megiddo, The Not Arkhad (64)

I have a friend! I never thought I would make friends, but now I now, I, I have one! Work! :sob: These are tears of happiness....... Of all the rules this is probably the most important. You must consider yourself an asset.
As an employee you are worth a certain amount. The more you're worth, the more likely you'll get a pay raise. Thus, you must invest in yourself.

### Modern Translation

- Think of ways to become more valuable to your employer. The more valuable you become the more reasons you deserve a raise.

- Invest in your skills, read about your industry.
