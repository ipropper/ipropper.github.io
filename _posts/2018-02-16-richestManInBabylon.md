# Start Thy Purse To Fattening - Babylonian Lessons In the Modern Era

The Richest man in Babylon offers seven rules for handling money.
The seven **gold**-en  rules are as follows:

## The Golden Rules

1. Start thy purse to Fattening
  - At a minimum 10% of all income should go towards savings
2. Control thy Expenditure
	- Buy less. No more, yes less
3. Make they gold multiply
	- Invest your savings
4. Guard thy treasure from loss (subtle and not)
	- Always shop around, get multiple opinions, work to understand your investment
5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment
	- Weigh the cost of buying/renting, consider leasing your possessions.
6. Insure future income
	- Setup an emergency fund, plan for the unexpected
7. Increase thy ability to earn
	- Invest in your abilities, always grow

The golden rules are presented by Arkhad, the richest man in Babylon
(Hey that's the books title!). He acts as our guide for navigating each rule. For each rule I share some of Arkhad's wisdom, and how I interpret it.  

## 1. Start Thy purse to Fattening

> "Thy purse will start to fatten at once and its increasing weight will feel good
in thy hand." - Arkhad, the Richest Man in Babylon (19)

Arkhad offers a simple cure to a lean wallet. Save money. Mind :boom:. More precisely,
devote 10% (minimum) of each paycheck for the purpose of savings. Parting ways with
1/10th your salary can be difficult, but to that Akhad offers the following wisdom:
 "When I ceased to pay out more than nine-tenths of my earnings, I managed to get along just as well" (19).
In short you won't miss that 10%? Easy for you to say Arkhad, but this is my money we're talking about `-_-`. Oh well let's give it a go.

### Modern Action

- Setup automatic withdraws from your bank account to a savings/investment account.
- Each withdraw should be >= 10% of your paycheck.

Example:

If you make 100$ a month, 10$ will go towards savings. After 10 months you
will have one paycheck saved, after 10 years you will have your years salary.
Math is cool like that :sunglasses:.

## 2. Control Thy Expenditure

> " Study thoughtfully thy accustomed habits of living... Certain
accepted expenses may wisely be reduced or eliminated" - Arkhad, the $ in Babylon (20)

Spend less, and you will have more money. Another mental puzzle from Arkhad.
The lesson is not entirely obvious however. Arkhad doesn't just say "spend less",
he also advises you to record how you spend money. In recording your expenses,
you might find expenses that could easily be avoided. Now I'll be damned before
I stop contributing to my 73 and a half Beany Baby collection
(sorry [Valentino](http://lovemybeanies.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/Valentino.jpg), we're both hearth broken now), but maybe I could eat out less.

### Modern Action

- Record purchases, see what you can cut. Try budgeting apps like
[mint](https://www.mint.com/), it automatically tracks your spending.
For the die-hards even a spreadsheet can do the job.
- Eat out less, cook more.
- Only drink water, it's healthy yay! and flavorless, yay?
- Lower gas/heating/electricity use
- Walk/run/bike instead of other transport
- Don't develop a crippling addiction to plushy toys


## 3. Make Thy gold multiply
>I tell you, my students, a man's wealth is not in the coins he carries in his purse; it is the
income he buildeth, the golden stream that continually floweth into his purse and keepeth it always bulging. - Arkhad, Babylon's Richy Rich (21)

Saving money is great! But if you don't have anything to do with it, it just sorta
lays their and does nothing, like my stoner friend Tyler.  It would be nice if
there was a way to make our cash grow. That's what this lesson is all about.
Getting your money to work for you so that you have "a golden stream that continually floweth into your purse?" (is that a weird Analogy?). Akhad states that every coin you
make is a potential worker that can earn more money. All you need to do is invest it.

### Modern Translation

Seek out investment opportunities.

Some ideas:
- [ETFs](http://freakonomics.com/podcast/stupidest-thing-can-money/)
- Bonds/CD
- [IRA](https://twocents.lifehacker.com/a-beginner-s-guide-to-opening-an-ira-1607498930)
- 401K
- [Real-Estate](https://www.reit.com/)

I setup a [Vanguard](https://investor.vanguard.com/corporate-portal/) account
that automatically withdraws and invests money for me.
There may be better or riskier investments, but the above was a great for getting
my feet wet. (Stop thinking about the golden stream thing. It was a weird analogy OK?!?)  


## 4. Guard thy treasure from loss

> "Would you go to the breadmaker to inquire about the stars?" - Arkhad,
the golden stream guy (13)

When I first read this rule I thought it was advising me to protect my money
from thieves, robbers, bloggers, you know, scoundrels. As I read more
I understood "loss" to be something more subtle. Loss
is better categorized as falling prey to a lack of information.

At the core of the law is the principal that you should make informed investments.
Don't buy something without shopping around. Get quotes,
second opinions etc. The book tackles this idea with a question:

> Should you trust brick makers with jewelry investments?

In the book Algamish does just that, and ends up with worthless knock off jewels.  
The moral, why would a brick maker know more about jewels than you? A jeweler might be
a better source of information. The point is, you should try to understand what
you're buying or investing in.

### My Translation

- Whenever buying something shop around, and set price alerts.
You can check the historical price
of an item with sites like [Camel Camel Camel](https://camelcamelcamel.com/)
and ebay/craigslist can have excellent used goods.

- Read about what you're investing in.

- When seeking advice, try to ask those must familiar with that product.
Ask jewelers about jewels, brick makers about bricks. Don't ask Tyler's opinion on
anything, you're not a baby and [beany babies aren't worthless.](http://moneyinc.com/most-expensive-beanie-babies/).

## 5. Make of thy dwelling a profitable investment

> "To a man's heart it brings gladness to eat the figs from his own trees
and the grapes of his own vines." - $Arkhad$ (23)

This rule states that it is often better to buy a home then to rent it. I'm not sure that idea is always true, but at some point buying a house is probably cheaper than renting. There's
also some stuff about growing figs? It's Febuary in Michigan, so I'm going to read that more metaphorically. The basic idea, things you own can produce value for you.

### Modern Translation

- One should weigh the cost of renting an apartment vs buying a home.

- Your assets can produce value. Consider renting your assets while you are not using them,
you can rent your room with [air b&b](https://www.airbnb.com/), car with
[turo](https://turo.com/), and even parking space with [spot hero](https://spothero.com/rent-my-parking-space/).


## 6. Insure Future income

> "A lean purse to a man no longer able to earn ... is a sore tragedy" - Arkhad$

If you live paycheck to paycheck, what happens when tragedy strikes? If you have no money on reserve, you won't be able to feed yourself. You might need a loan to pay for living expenses, or, worse, sell your priceless beany baby collection. This rule is all about having a small sum of cash reserved to cushion unexpected bad news.  

### Modern Translation

- Consider following this [vanguard guide](https://investor.vanguard.com/emergency-fund/),
for an emergency fund.

- Have 3-6 months expenses put in a [high yield savings account](https://www.nerdwallet.com/banking/best-savings-accounts).
This money will only be used in emergency.

- If you are having trouble saving for an emergency fund, divert some of the money in section 1 to an emergency fund.


## 7. Increase your ability to learn

>"Work is the best Friend I've ever known"- Megiddo (not Arkhad?) (64)

I have a friend! I never thought I would make friends, but now I know I have one, work! :tear: These are tears of happiness, happiness....... Of all the rules this is probably the most important. Like your home, you must consider yourself an asset. You generate a source of income and if you want that income source to grow, you must invest resources into yourself.

### Modern Translation

- Think of ways you can add more value to your company, by adding value you more valuable. The more money you bring in the more you are worth.

- Try to read on up on your industry. See how others solve the problems you are solving, they may provide valued advice.
